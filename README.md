# ABALONE PROJECT  
This Repository Abalone classification project. This is the first project in my self learning curriculum.

## Dataset
The dataset I have used can be found here ([https://www.kaggle.com/rodolfomendes/abalone-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rodolfomendes/abalone-dataset))

## Purpose of project
In the journey of learning machine learning especially classification EDA and classification model evaluation, I have made a self learning curriculum which is comprised of building 10 classification projects end-to-end involving steps, which are as follows:  
- Do the EDA
  - Using pandas, numpy, statsmoel, sklearn, seaborn and matplotlib
  - Check for bias-sampling such as data imbalance
  - descriptive statstics
    - Measure of central tendency
    - Measure of dispersion
    - Measure of association
    - Check for skewness and kurtosis
    - If needed data imputation
    - If needed data transformation
    - Outlier detection and handling
    
- Choose best Model
  - Train model systematically
  - Use ensemble models
  - Use cross-validation method to reduce variance error

- Do the model evaluation 
  - metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score and ROC-AUC
  - use mlxtent to observe bias variance decomposition of error
  - AIC and BIC for checking model bias-variance
  
## Building model API
Using flask library build model-api. Learn the folder structure of api backend which can be scaled later if required.

## Deploying API
Learn deplyment to digitalocean and deploying to heroku from github.
